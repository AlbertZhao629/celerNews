               Bandh; Gunfire Reported - YouTube</b>
            </h3>
            <p>Reports from Bihar showed attempts to block trains, while some
               schools suspended their bus services in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, which
               was the worst hit during the April 2 nationwide bandh called by Dalit
               groups with at least eight people being killed in violent protests.
               Officials in MP said the call for today's bandh was given on social
               media and no organisation had come forward so far to claim
               responsibility for it. In Rajasthan, which was also hit badly during
               the Dalit-convened bandh, the state government has issued prohibitory
               orders under the Section 144 of the CrPC and blocked mobile internet
               services in the state capital as precautionary measure. Yesterday, the
               union Home Ministry had issued advisory to all states to beef up
               security and prevent violence during the Bharat Bandh against
               caste-based reservations in jobs and education. In Gujarat, which has
               seen several Dalit protests of late, the response to the bandh call,
               was tepid, with most establishments and markets remaining open. The
               central government has sent 30 companies of Central Reserve Police
               Force-the country's largest paramilitary force-to various states to
               maintain law and order during the bandh. Home Ministry officials said
               14 of these companies have been sent to Uttar Pradesh, eight to
               Rajasthan, and four each to Madhya Pradesh and Bihar to prevent any
               untoward incident during the bandh called in protest against the
               country's reservation policy. <br>
               PATNA: At least 127 people were arrested from different parts of Bihar
               during the nationwide anti-quota bandh on Tuesday. Though security had
               been beefed up by the state government, violence was reported from
               Anand Nagar locality at Ara, 50km west from Patna, where several
               rounds were fired in the air during a clash. ADG of police S K Singhal
               said two groups came face to face at Ara during which the firing took
               place. " Altogether 56 people were arrested in Bhojpur district, 18 in
               Nawada, 24 in Gaya and 29 people were arrested in Darbhanga district,"
               Singhal said, adding the HQ also received reports of road and rail
               blockades from several places. Singhal said Union minister of state
               for HRD Upendra Kushwaha's cavalcade was stopped at Loma in Vaishali
               district while he was on way to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi's
               programme at Motihari. One company of RAF each had been deployed in
               Patna and East Champaran districts while one company of CPRF each had
               been deployed in Gaya and Muzaffarpur districts to maintain peace
               during the bandh. Two companies of SSB were also deployed - one each
               in Begusarai and Darbhanga districts. <br>
               Additional security measures have been taken in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya
               Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand's Haridwar to deter a rerun of the
               violence that hit many cities during the Bharat Bandh call by some
               Dalit groups on April 2 over a Supreme Court order that allegedly
               diluted certain key provisions of the SC/ST Act. Anti-quota groups
               call for Bharat bandh today as the Home Ministry has issued an
               advisory to states to beef up security and prevent violence during the
               Bandh pic. 10:40 AM: Several Policemen have been injured in protests
               during Bharat Bandh today. 10:05 AM: Maximum impact of Bharat Bandh is
               being witnessed in Bihar. 10:00 AM: Bharat Bandh impact in Uttar
               Pradesh - Internet services has been suspended from 6 pm Monday to 6
               pm Tuesday following the order of the District Magistrate in Hapur.
               9:30 AM: Bharat Bandh impact in Bihar: A train in stopped by
               protesters in Bihar's Arrah. 9:00 AM: Reports are coming from Uttar
               Pradresh that there is no impact of Bharat Bandh call seen as yet in
               Meerut. <br>

                  vetoed a U.S.-drafted Security Council resolution on probe of
                  chemical weapons use in Syria on Tuesday. UNITED NATIONS, April 10 -

                  Russia and the United States continuing to shoot down each other's

                  important differences. The key point is our resolution guarantees
                  that any investigations will truly be independent. Russia's
                  resolution gives Russia itself the chance to choose the

               <p>Russia vetoed a U.S.-drafted resolution at the United Nations
                  Tuesday that would have condemned a suspected poison gas attack by
                  the Syrian regime on a Damascus suburb. It was the 12th time Russia
                  has vetoed a resolution concerning Syria and sixth veto related to
                  chemical weapons. Earlier Tuesday, the international chemical
                  weapons watchdog said it was sending a fact-finding mission to the
                  Israel does not typically comment on its operations in Syria, and it
                  is unclear whether the missile attack was linked to the alleged use
                  of chemical weapons. Syria became a member in 2013 as part of a deal
                  brokered by the U.S. and Russia after a chemical attack in eastern
                  Ghouta killed hundreds of people. The Syrian government and its
                  Russian backers strongly deny the allegations, and questioned
                  whether a chemical weapons attack even took place. Russia vetoes

               <p>Russia has vetoed a U.S.-drafted U.N. resolution that would have
                  condemned last weekend's suspected gas attack near Damascus and
                  established a new body to determine responsibility for Syrian
                  chemical weapons attacks. The vote Tuesday afternoon in the
                  15-member Security Council was 12 in favor, Bolivia joining Russia
                  in voting " No," and China abstaining. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley
                  said the United States " Went the extra mile " to get Russian
                  support for the resolution to ensure that a new investigative body
                  would be impartial, independent and professional - things she said
                  would not be guaranteed by a rival Russian resolution. Russia's U.N.
                  Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused the United States of wanting the
                  resolution to fail " To justify the use of force against Syria." He
                  said the resolution was trying to recreate the old expert body,
                  whose extension Moscow blocked in November. He called that body " a
                  puppet in the hands of anti-Damascus forces."

         <b>Russia Vetoes U.S. Draft Resolution at U.N. to Investigate Suspected
         Chemical Attack in Syria | KTLA</b>
         <p>Russia vetoed a US draft resolution at the UN Security Council Tuesday
            that would have established an independent investigation into the
            suspected use of chemical weapons in Syria. The US draft condemned the
            suspected attack by the Assad regime in Douma, demanded immediate access
            for humanitarian workers to the region and called for an inquiry. A
            Russian resolution that would have set up an investigation overseen by
            the Security Council also failed to pass. Seven nations - including the
            US - voted against the Russian draft which, according to US Ambassador
            the UN Nikki Haley, was designed to give Russia a chance to approve the
            investigators who were chosen for the task and allow the Security
            Council to assess the findings of the investigation before any report
            was released. On Monday, Haley told the Security Council that the US
            will respond to the Assad regime's alleged chemical attack against
            Syrian civilians as she excoriated Russia, saying its hands are "
            Covered in the blood of Syrian children." " Chemical weapons have once
            again been used on Syrian men, women and children," Haley said at
            Monday's meeting to discuss what appeared to be a chemical attack on
            Douma, the last rebel-held town in Syria, on Saturday that left 49
            people dead and scores injured. Images of gasping children struggling to
            breathe shocked the world and galvanized President Donald Trump, who

               <p>Terrified employees fled as gunfire rang out at YouTube's sprawling
                  headquarters in San Bruno, California, on Tuesday, prompting a
                  massive police response and evacuation as victims were transported
                  to nearby hospitals. San Bruno police identified the suspect late
                  Tuesday as Nasim Najafi Aghdam, 39, who was found dead from what
                  authorities believe is a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The suspect's
                  father, Ismail Aghdam, told CBS Los Angeles his daughter had gone
                  missing for several days, and that he called police because he was
                  concerned over her recent anger at YouTube. A spokesman for San
                  Francisco General Hospital told CBS News it has received three
                  patients: a 36-year-old man in critical condition, a 32-year-old
                  woman in serious condition and a 27-year-old woman in fair
                  condition. Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube's HQ in San
                  Bruno, California. YouTube's headquarters is about 12 miles south of
                  downtown San Francisco, close to San Francisco International
                  Airport. Google says there are more than 1,100 employees at the
                  office and that YouTube is San Bruno's largest employer, with a
                  variety of people dedicated engineering and sales. YouTube Shooting:

               <p>San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini said a woman was found dead
                  from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The woman suspected in the
                  shootings has been identified as Nasim Aghdam, 39, of Southern
                  California, CBS News has confirmed. Her father told CBS2 News late
                  Tuesday that he had warned YouTube of his daughter's anger toward
                  the video-sharing company. A law-enforcement source had earlier told
                  CBS News the wounded male was believed to be the suspected shooter's
                  boyfriend. Armed with a 9 mm handgun, Aghdam asked for him by name,
                  authorities told CBS News. Employees at the YouTube offices in Playa
                  Vista were given the option to go home after the shooting at the
                  company's headquarters, according to CBS2's Joy Benedict. A
                  spokesman for San Francisco General Hospital told CBS News it has
                  received three patients: a 36-year-old man in critical condition, a
                  32-year-old woman in serious condition and a 27-year-old woman in
                  fair condition.

                     it was a Piper PA-24 plane which crashed on the TPC Scottsdale
                     Champions Golf Course shortly after taking off on Monday night
                     just before 8:45 p.m. Video of the crash posted to social media
                     shows the small aircraft in flames as smoke billows into the air.
                     There were no survivors of a fiery plane crash on the TPC
                     Scottsdale Champions Golf Course in Arizona. The Scottsdale Police
                     Department said none of the six passengers aboard the aircraft
                     survived. The department added that names are not being released "
                     Pending identification and notifications." There were several
                     witnesses who watched the fiery crash play out. The National
                     Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation into the
                     deadly crash. This article has been updated with a statement from

                     on a suburban Phoenix golf course adjacent to the grounds where
                     the PGA Tour holds a popular tournament. ABC15 reports that

                     Course, the sister course to the Stadium Course where the Waste

                  <p>Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican from Alaska, asked CEO Mark
                     Zuckerberg if Facebook was too powerful. " Are you too powerful?
                     And do you think you are too powerful?" Sullivan asked. Instead,
                     Zuckerberg responded that when people talk about Facebook's scale
                     - conflating size with power - they are referencing the 2 billion
                     in its community, most of which are outside the US. " I think
                     that's something to your point Americans should be proud of," he
                     said. The conversation quickly shifted to content and regulation,
                     where Zuckerberg said he views Facebook as a tech company, not a
                     publishing company. He added that Facebook is responsible for the
                     content, but they don't produce it.

                     <p>" The President has made no decision regarding the interview
                        but anybody with common sense will see the attack on his lawyer
                        as cause to reevaluate," the official said. The official added
                        that the President's cooperation should be proportional to the
                        courtesy he receives from the special counsel. The raid on
                        Cohen's office is viewed by the White House as not showing the
                        President that courtesy, the official said. A source close to
                        the President said there have been ongoing negotiations between
                        Mueller's team and the President's legal team for a potential
                        interview, but the raid on the President's personal attorney has
                        upended those discussions. CNN reported last week that members
                        of the President's legal team have been informally prepping him
                        for a possible interview, though no decision on the matter has
                        been made. The President's anger over the raid as well as a new
                        assessment of what the implications of the raid could be for
                        Cohen's most prominent client, Trump, are factors that the
                        President's legal team has to take into account. The President
                        has not formally agreed to sit for an interview with Mueller.

                              improve intellectual property protection and boost imports.
                              Xi's pledges at a business conference came as China filed a
                              World Trade Organization challenge over one aspect of its
                              sprawling conflict with President Donald Trump - last
                              month's U.S. tariff hike on steel and aluminum. Strains over
                              U.S. complaints that China is flooding global markets with
                              unfairly low-priced goods and pressuring foreign companies
                              to hand over technology have spiraled into the biggest trade
                              conflict since World War II. Speaking to Chinese and foreign
                              businesspeople, Xi didn't mention Trump or their dispute. In
                              his speech, Xi tried to position China as a defender of free
                              trade, despite its status as the most-closed major economy,
                              in response to Trump's " America first " calls for import
                              restrictions and trade deals that are more favorable to the
                              United States. Jake Parker, the vice president for China of
                              the U.S.-China Business Council, an industry group, welcomed
                              Xi's announcement but expressed hope for additional steps
                              such as ending requirements for joint ventures and
                              technology licensing. More broadly, Xi repeated official
                              promises to expand imports and to narrow China's trade
                              surplus, which reached $ 423 billion last year - about
                              two-thirds of that with the United States. " China does not
                              seek a trade surplus," said Xi in comments that were
                              broadcast on national television.
